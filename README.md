# My First React App

This is just a simple app which shows a React.js logo that when you click it, a counter will rise and the image's top and bottom margins raises.
The count can be seen in the reset button which is below the image and when clicked, will reset the counter (and the margins accordingly)

## Build

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run Build
```
